Based on the open source Plone CMS platform, our goal is to develop the custom HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, RULES.XML and other settings to setup Plone for the purposes of an internal company resource center Intranet.


Features requirements:

 - Not just mobile friendly, but mobile first responsive design
 
 - Well written and sound HTML, CSS Viewports, and Javascript to make responsive design flexible and future updates clean and easy

 - UX specifically targeting a mobile workforce needing fast and easy access to company resources typically provided by support and corporate personnel

 - Navigation and tool menus that are easy to use and don't interfere with the primary view of written knowledge articles.

 - Clean and modern UI providing easy to read articles and information resources
